# Credit Card Fraud Detection 💳🔍

Built a simple machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using logistic regression.

## 🎯 Objective
To classify transactions as fraud or non-fraud using basic supervised learning, and understand how to deal with imbalanced datasets.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 📈 Approach
- Loaded and cleaned real credit card transaction data.
- Used Logistic Regression to build a binary classification model.
- Evaluated results using confusion matrix and classification report.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib`
3. Run `fraud_detection.py` or the notebook

## 🧠 Outcome
- ~85% accuracy
- Learned to handle class imbalance using techniques like stratified split and evaluation metrics beyond accuracy.
